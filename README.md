# hello-world

Hey, thanks for visiting my profile. This is my first time here as well :D

I am a mechanical engineering undergrad (writing this is july 2020 BTW) and I wanted to do something interesting with my time as my college is closed and I am bored sitting at home.

I tried my hand with cooking and music (I can play basic tunes on a keyboard :P) and decided to learn coding after they failed to keep my interest for long. I found an Udemy course on Python by Jose Portilla and completed it and I must say it was a great experience. I am still not very commfortable with writing my own programs without help yet although I can mostly understand what's going on, looking at other people's code

I just wanted to pass my time with something interesting to do and now I have a new useful skill :D

Feel free to hit me up.
